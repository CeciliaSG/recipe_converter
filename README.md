<h1 align="center">Recipe Ingredient Converter</h1>

[View the live project here](https://recipe-converter-0e511cb84db5.herokuapp.com/) and the [Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxRmrXuh0vBWrZJDnR1j-UeINHnjVnlFtAIUtNRiUoE/edit?pli=1#gid=1522122947)

This is a recipe ingredient conversion app, and would most probably be part of a more extensive recipe site. The apps function is to facilitate the users experience, by easily converting the recipe ingredients for number of portions, and for either metric or imperial units. The apps function is for all users who waant to cook a recipe on the website or blog. The app doesn't include the cooking method as this would be part of the more extensive site, but could be included if one wanted to.

The app converts ingredient amounts from one upto 100 portions. It also converts metric measurements to imperial if the user wants those instead.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Visitor Goals

        - As a visitor/user of the conversion app, I want to easily understand how it works, the main purpose and have it facilitate my cooking by making it simple to get the correct measurements for the number of people I am cooking for.

### Future features and usage, things to change or do differently

Creating the app has been a great learning experience, and if I had more time I would now go back and change a few things. One would be that I should have stored all values and keys in the program and built a specific function for the calculations. This is something I have ralised along the way, but now don't have time to go back and change.

### Languages Used

-   [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [gspread:](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/)
    - Google spreadshees was used to store the recipe ingredients, measurements and units.
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
2. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
4. [Lucidchart:](https://lucid.app/)
    - Lucidchart was used to create the flowchart during initial development. To visualise theflow of the program. During the development steps were added that wern't initially in the flowchart.

## Testing

The CI Python Linter was used to check the code. On the first few checks there were some warning for long lines and white spaces which were then fixed.

## Further Testing

-   The apps functionality was tested all through the development process.

### Manual testing:

| Action| Description |  Result |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Display recipe | Program fetches the recipe titles from the spreadsheet| Titles are displayed  |
| Choose recipe| The user is prompted to input a choice | You have chosen mashed potatoes. This recipe is available.  |
| Choose portions| The user is prompted to input portions| Portions: 90 Portions âœ”     |
| Choose metric/imperial| The user is prompted to choose imperial/metric |  The program prints the users choice  |
| Another recipe yes/no| The user is aksed if they want to cook something else. yes/no? |  no - and the program ends, yes - and the program starts again. |


## Testing incorrect input:

| Action|  Result | Improvement suggestions|
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| The user presss enter without entering anything | Your choice:  No such recipe. Please choose recipe in our recipe bank.| | 
| User enters incorrect recipe| Your choice: mongolian beef. No such recipe. Please choose recipe in our recipe bank.
| User enters incorrect numerical value for portions |Portions: 0 Not a correct choice: Choose a number between 1 and 100, you provided 0 Not a valid choice. Please try again |    | 
| User enters wrong value for metric/imperial| Please enter valid choice Please choose imperial/metric: |   | 
| User enters wrong value for yes/no| Invalid choice. Please enter yes or no. Do you want to cook something else? (yes/no) | | 

## Checking conversions:

| Action| Description |  Result |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Mltiply no. of portions by ingredients | Gets the correct ingredients multiplies by the correct no. of portions| Return the result in metric measurements| Works as it should |
| Convert measurements for large no.| If a large number of portions are requested, the program will convert dl to litre(s), tbsp to dl etc.| Seems to work as it should|
| Convert measuremetns to imperial| When imperial units are chosen| Seems to work as it should when tested (with small exception see know bugs) |
| Convert imperial for large numbers| Converts ounces to pounds and tbsp to cups|  Seems to work as it should when tested (with small exception see know bugs) |

### Known Bugs

-   I encountered an issue when testing the conversion to imperial units, only for specific units and the issue seemed to be related to the order or the ingredients in the spreadsheet. Rearranging the order solved the problem. This issue needs to be adressed. i tried several solution, but found that it only worked for for a smaller number of portions and not when converting large number of portions to imperial units.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

## Creating the Heroku app, deploying to Heroku

Steps to follow for deployment to Heroku:

### In GitHub.
1. Navigate to the repository for the project. 

### In Heroku

1.	Go to Heroku, create account, if you don't have one, and log in.
2.	Go to the dashboard and click New after which you click Create new app
3.	Choose name and region. Click Create app
4.	Go to Settings, under the "Config Vars" set your Key/Value Pairs.
    You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
    If you have credentials, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
    When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:
    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`

5.	In the Buildpacks section, add buildpacks. Note order in which you add buildpacks: Python first and nodejs.
6.	No go to Deployment. In deployment method click on "GitHub"(for repository)
7.	The connect to GitHub, find your repository and click  connect.
8.	Under connect to GitHub-section, you can either chose automatic deploys with Enable Automatic Deploys or Manual Deploy, to deploy manually.
    
    **Now you can view the deployed app.**
